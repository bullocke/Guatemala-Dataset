** DATASET DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND

From 2012 to 2017 the Republic of Guatemala, in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), instituted a program for the clarification, mapping, and demarcation of land rights for the country's protected areas. This dataset was developed as part of an evaluation as to the effectiveness of the program in preventing deforestation and degradation in the protected areas.  

The CODED algorithm has three main components: forest/non-forest classification, change detection, and disturbance attribution. Disturbances that occur in forested landscapes and result in a change in land cover are labeled as deforestation. If the disturbance does not result in a change in land cover it is labeled as degradation. While the CODED algorithm records all changes over the study period, only the first degradation event and first deforestation event is represented in this dataset.
